                    In 2016, the Arizona Legislature passed SB 1350, stripping cities and counties of the power to regulate short-term rentals in their own communities. It didn't happen by accident.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bill was <strong>model legislation</strong> written by ALEC — the American Legislative Exchange Council — a corporate-funded organization that connects lobbyists directly with state legislators to craft pro-business laws. The same bill was pushed in statehouses across the country.

                <div class="player-card">
                    <h3>ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council)</h3>
                    <p class="player-role">The Ghostwriter</p>
                    <p>ALEC is a nonprofit that brings together corporations and state legislators — almost exclusively Republicans — to draft "model legislation" that benefits corporate interests. SB 1350 was based on ALEC's template, and nearly identical bills were introduced in multiple states the same year.</p>
                    <p>After SB 1350 passed, ALEC's Tax and Fiscal Policy Task Force adopted it as official model policy for other states to follow.</p>

                <div class="player-card highlight">
                    <h3>Sen. Debbie Lesko</h3>
                    <p class="player-role">The Sponsor — ALEC "Legislator of the Year" 2016</p>
                    <p>Then-State Senator Debbie Lesko (now a U.S. Congresswoman) sponsored SB 1350. For her work passing the bill, ALEC named her their <strong>2016 Legislator of the Year</strong>.</p>
                    <p>ALEC praised Lesko as "the most competent, no-nonsense State Chair who does the best job of bringing members to meetings, representing ALEC to her fellow legislators."</p>
                    <p class="note">The bill passed the Senate with only one vote against it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="player-card">
                    <h3>Airbnb & Expedia</h3>
                    <p class="player-role">The Beneficiaries</p>
                    <p>Airbnb and Expedia (which owns Vrbo) lobbied heavily for the bill and have continued lobbying against any reforms. In 2020, Arizona mayors sent a letter directly to the CEOs of both companies asking them to "immediately end lobbying activities designed to prevent reform of this disastrous state law which your industry promoted."</p>

                    <p class="player-role">The Signature</p>
                    <p>Governor Ducey signed SB 1350 into law, making Arizona one of only six states to preempt local control over short-term rentals. The others: Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.</p>

                <h2>The Vote</h2>
                <p>SB 1350 passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. <strong>Every Democratic lawmaker who voted on the bill voted in favor.</strong> Only one senator voted against it.</p>
                <p>This wasn't a partisan failure — it was a lobbying success. Corporate interests outspent and out-organized Arizona communities, and legislators from both parties went along with it.</p>
