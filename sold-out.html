                    In 2016, the Arizona Legislature sold your neighborhood to the highest bidder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SB 1350 stripped cities and counties of the power to regulate short-term rentals in their own communities. Your elected officials — the people who were supposed to represent <em>you</em> — voted to hand control of your street to out-of-state corporations. <strong>It didn't happen by accident.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bill was <strong>model legislation</strong> written by ALEC — the American Legislative Exchange Council — a corporate-funded shadow organization that connects lobbyists directly with state legislators behind closed doors. The same bill was pushed in statehouses across the country. Arizona was one of only six states that actually passed it.

                    <p class="player-role">The Sponsor — ALEC's "Legislator of the Year" 2016</p>
                    <p>Then-State Senator Debbie Lesko didn't just vote for SB 1350 — she <strong>sponsored</strong> it. She carried water for corporate lobbyists and was rewarded handsomely: ALEC named her their <strong>2016 Legislator of the Year</strong>.</p>
                    <p>ALEC praised Lesko as "the most competent, no-nonsense State Chair who does the best job of bringing members to meetings, representing ALEC to her fellow legislators." Translation: she was their best salesperson in the Arizona legislature.</p>
                    <p>After sponsoring this gift to corporations, Lesko was elected to Congress in 2018, where she served until January 2025. She's now on the <strong>Maricopa County Board of Supervisors</strong> — still making decisions that affect Arizona communities.</p>
                    <p class="note">The bill passed the Senate 29-1. Almost every legislator in both parties voted to strip your community of local control.</p>

                    <p>These Silicon Valley giants don't live in your neighborhood. They don't hear the 2 AM parties. They don't watch strangers come and go. They just collect their cut — and spend millions making sure you can't do anything about it.</p>
                    <p>Airbnb and Expedia (which owns Vrbo) lobbied heavily for SB 1350 and have fought every reform since. In 2020, Arizona mayors were so fed up they sent a letter directly to both CEOs, demanding they <strong>"immediately end lobbying activities designed to prevent reform of this disastrous state law which your industry promoted."</strong></p>
                    <p>The companies ignored them. Why wouldn't they? The law is working exactly as intended — for them.</p>

                    <p>Governor Ducey signed SB 1350 into law without hesitation, making Arizona one of only <strong>six states in the entire country</strong> to completely preempt local control over short-term rentals. The company we keep: Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.</p>
                    <p>Ducey could have vetoed it. He didn't. He chose corporate interests over Arizona communities — and he never looked back.</p>

                    <p>ALEC is where corporate lobbyists and state legislators meet in secret to write laws that benefit corporations — not you. They literally sit in the same room, at the same table, and draft bills together. Then your "representative" introduces it as if it were their own idea.</p>
                    <p>SB 1350 was based on ALEC's template. Nearly identical bills were introduced in multiple states the same year — a coordinated assault on local control. After Arizona fell, ALEC adopted the bill as official model policy, using your community as a success story to sell to other states.</p>

                <p>Here's the ugly truth: <strong>this wasn't a partisan failure. It was a bipartisan sellout.</strong></p>
                <p>SB 1350 passed with overwhelming support from both parties. Only <em>one single senator</em> in the entire chamber voted no. Republicans and Democrats alike lined up to strip your community of local control.</p>
                <p>Why? Because corporate lobbyists outspent and out-organized Arizona communities. They wined and dined legislators from both parties. And both parties went along with it.</p>
