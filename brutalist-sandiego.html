                    San Diego's brutalist legacy is concentrated on the coastal cliffs of La Jolla, where the University of California San Diego and the Salk Institute created one of the most remarkable concentrations of modernist architecture in America. Here, raw concrete meets the Pacific light.

                        <h2>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">10010 N Torrey Pines Road | Louis Kahn | 1965</p>
                        <p>
                            Louis Kahn's masterpiece is widely considered one of the most important buildings of the 20th century. Jonas Salk, developer of the polio vaccine, wanted a facility where scientists would feel like artists. Kahn delivered something transcendent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two mirror-image laboratory blocks frame a central travertine courtyard that channels the eye directly toward the Pacific Ocean. A thin stream of water bisects the plaza, running toward the horizon. The concrete was poured with volcanic ash from Italy, giving it warm, honeyed tones that glow at sunset.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kahn's design separates "served" spaces (labs) from "servant" spaces (mechanical systems), with interstitial floors that allow complete flexibility for scientific equipment. The teak-framed study towers provide private spaces for contemplation.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Geisel Library</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">UC San Diego | William Pereira | 1970</p>
                        <p>
                            Named for Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and his wife Audrey, this library has become the symbol of UC San Diego. William Pereira's design appears to hover above the eucalyptus canyon on massive splayed concrete supports.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The inverted pyramid form isn't just dramatic—it's functional. Each successive floor expands outward, maximizing usable space while minimizing the building's footprint on the environmentally sensitive site. The cantilevered floors provide shade for the glass curtain walls below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pereira, who also designed San Francisco's Transamerica Pyramid, believed architecture should be "space-age" without being gimmicky. The Geisel Library achieves this balance, appearing futuristic sixty years later.
                        </p>

                        <h2>UCSD Muir College Buildings</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">UC San Diego | Dale Naegle / Mosher Drew | 1968–1972</p>
                        <p>
                            Muir College, the second of UCSD's residential colleges, features some of the campus's most committed brutalist architecture. The Humanities & Social Sciences Building and Applied Physics & Mathematics building present fortress-like facades of board-formed concrete.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The buildings are organized around courtyards and covered walkways that respond to San Diego's climate—deep overhangs provide shade while allowing natural ventilation. The rough concrete surfaces were designed to weather naturally, developing character over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These structures represent the optimism of California's Master Plan for Higher Education, which dramatically expanded public university access in the 1960s. They were built quickly and economically but with serious architectural ambition.

                        <h2>Urey Hall (Chemistry Building)</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">UC San Diego | Robert Mosher | 1966</p>
                        <p>
                            One of the original UCSD buildings, Urey Hall exemplifies the campus's early commitment to modernism. Named after Nobel laureate Harold Urey, who helped establish UCSD's chemistry department, the building features dramatic cantilevered lecture halls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The exposed concrete structure celebrates the building's engineering, with mechanical systems left visible as part of the aesthetic. Like much of UCSD's original campus, Urey Hall demonstrates how brutalism could serve educational purposes—its tough materials standing up to heavy laboratory use while creating inspiring spaces.
