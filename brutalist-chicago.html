                    Chicago, birthplace of the skyscraper and home to architectural innovation for over a century, embraced brutalism with characteristic boldness. From the geometric experiments of Walter Netsch's UIC campus to one of America's most distinctive federal buildings, Chicago's brutalist legacy stands tall against the lakefront wind.

                        <p class="building-meta">71 W Van Buren Street | Harry Weese | 1975</p>
                        <p>
                            Harry Weese—the same architect who designed Washington's Metro system—created one of America's most unusual federal buildings: a 27-story triangular prison in the heart of Chicago's Loop. The MCC was designed to bring federal detention into the modern era, replacing the grim warehouses of earlier generations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The triangular floor plan maximizes natural light while minimizing the building's footprint. Those distinctive 5-inch-wide windows—too narrow to squeeze through—eliminated the need for bars while still allowing daylight and views. The concrete exterior features an unusual slit pattern that gives the tower a textile-like quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Weese believed even a jail could be humane architecture. The MCC includes a rooftop recreation area and was designed around the idea that inmates awaiting trial deserve dignity. It remains an active federal detention facility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> This is a working federal facility; exterior viewing only.

                        <h2>UIC University Hall</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">601 S Morgan Street | Walter Netsch / SOM | 1965</p>
                        <p>
                            The 28-story University Hall dominates the UIC campus, its distinctive profile rising from a brutalist base of lecture halls and administrative spaces. Walter Netsch designed the building as part of his comprehensive master plan for the Chicago Circle Campus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Netsch was obsessed with geometry. His "field theory" approach to design generated complex interlocking forms from simple mathematical relationships. University Hall's facade reveals this thinking—the expressed concrete frame creates a rhythm of solids and voids that shifts as you move around the building.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The building was controversial from the start. The campus displaced an Italian-American neighborhood, and Netsch's uncompromising vision felt alienating to many. But architecturally, UIC represents one of the most ambitious attempts to design a complete urban campus from scratch.

                        <h2>Behavioral Sciences Building (BSB)</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">1007 W Harrison Street | Walter Netsch / SOM | 1967</p>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the purest expression of Netsch's field theory, the Behavioral Sciences Building appears to grow organically from its site through a series of interlocking geometric forms. The building's massing creates sheltered courtyards and covered walkways at ground level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The concrete is left exposed throughout, inside and out, with board-formed textures creating visual warmth. Netsch arranged the building's masses to frame views across campus while providing protection from Chicago's harsh climate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BSB demonstrates how brutalism could serve complex programmatic needs—research labs, classrooms, offices, and common spaces—while maintaining architectural coherence. It's a building you can study for hours and still discover new relationships.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Joseph Regenstein Library</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">1100 E 57th Street | Walter Netsch / SOM | 1970</p>
                        <p>
                            Netsch's other major Chicago commission sits at the University of Chicago, where the massive Regenstein Library holds over 4.5 million volumes. The building's fortress-like limestone and concrete exterior belies remarkably humane interior spaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regenstein is organized around a central atrium that brings natural light deep into the building. Reading rooms feature generous windows and warm wood finishes that soften the brutalist exterior. The building steps down from seven stories to one as it meets the surrounding campus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The library demonstrates brutalism's flexibility—the same architectural language that produced UIC's aggressive geometry here creates spaces for quiet contemplation. Generations of Chicago students have written dissertations in its reading rooms.
