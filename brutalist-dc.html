                    No American city embraced brutalism for its federal architecture quite like Washington, D.C. In the 1960s and 70s, a generation of architects reimagined what government buildings could be—bold, democratic, and unapologetically modern. Today, many of these structures face uncertain futures.

                        <h2>Robert C. Weaver Federal Building (HUD)</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">451 7th Street SW | Marcel Breuer | 1968</p>
                        <p>
                            The headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development is named after Robert C. Weaver, the first African American to serve in a presidential cabinet. Marcel Breuer, the Hungarian-American modernist who also designed the Whitney Museum in New York, created a building that seems to float above its plaza on Y-shaped concrete supports.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The curved, scalloped facade creates a constantly shifting interplay of light and shadow throughout the day. Breuer believed federal buildings should inspire civic pride—the HUD building achieves this through bold geometry rather than classical columns.
                        </p>
                        <p class="threat-note">
                            <strong>Under Threat:</strong> The current administration has targeted this building for potential demolition or major alteration as part of broader plans to reshape federal real estate in the capital.

                        <h2>Washington Metro Stations</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">System-wide | Harry Weese | 1976–2001</p>
                        <p>
                            Chicago architect Harry Weese designed one of the most celebrated transit systems in the world. The Metro's signature coffered concrete vaults create cathedral-like spaces underground, their repeated geometric forms stretching into dramatic perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Weese insisted on design consistency across all stations while allowing each to respond to its specific site. Indirect lighting washes up the vault surfaces, emphasizing their sculptural quality. The system proves that infrastructure can be both functional and transcendent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Notable Stations:</strong> Dupont Circle (deepest vault), Bethesda (tallest escalator), Metro Center (network hub), Rosslyn (dramatic depth)

                        <h2>Hirshhorn Museum</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">Independence Ave & 7th Street SW | Gordon Bunshaft | 1974</p>
                        <p>
                            Gordon Bunshaft's cylindrical concrete drum sits elevated on four massive legs, appearing to float above its sunken sculpture garden. The building was controversial from the start—critics called it a "concrete doughnut"—but it has become an icon of the National Mall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The blank exterior walls were intentional: Bunshaft wanted no competition with the art inside. The circular galleries create a continuous viewing experience with no dead ends. Floor-to-ceiling windows on the inner ring overlook the sculpture garden and fountain below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Hirshhorn represents Bunshaft's belief that museums should be sculptural objects themselves, standing equal to the art they contain.

                        <h2>J. Edgar Hoover Building (FBI)</h2>
                        <p class="building-meta">935 Pennsylvania Avenue NW | Charles F. Murphy | 1975</p>
                        <p>
                            The FBI Headquarters occupies an entire city block on Pennsylvania Avenue, its massive concrete form creating a fortress-like presence between the Capitol and the White House. The building's controversial history mirrors that of its namesake, but architecturally it represents the ambitions of federal brutalism at their most monumental.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cantilevered upper floors project dramatically over the street-level plaza, while the exposed aggregate concrete surfaces were designed to weather and patina over time. Love it or hate it, the building commands attention.
                        </p>
                        <p class="threat-note">
                            <strong>Under Threat:</strong> Plans to relocate FBI headquarters to the suburbs have circulated for years, leaving the future of this Pennsylvania Avenue landmark uncertain.
