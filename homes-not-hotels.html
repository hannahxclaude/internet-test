                    Across Tucson, the house next door is increasingly likely to be a vacation rental — not a home. Gates Pass and neighborhoods throughout Pima County are feeling the squeeze as out-of-state investors snap up houses and convert them into commercial operations.

                            <p>Dear Supervisor,</p>

                            <p>As a resident of Pima County, I am writing to urge action on short-term rental accountability. Our residential neighborhoods are being transformed by commercial vacation rental operations, and we need the county to take meaningful steps within its existing authority.</p>

                            <p><strong>I respectfully request that Pima County:</strong></p>

                            <p>1. <strong>Establish a permit/license system for STR operators</strong> with the maximum allowable fee ($250). This creates accountability and provides a mechanism to suspend permits for bad actors.</p>

                            <p>2. <strong>Use permit data to ensure tax compliance.</strong> The Assessor's office should be able to identify STRs and confirm they are collecting and remitting Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) — Arizona's lodging tax that many operators currently avoid, shifting the burden to compliant taxpayers.</p>

                            <p>3. <strong>Create a public online registry</strong> so neighbors and HOAs can easily identify STRs in their communities and understand their rights.</p>

                            <p>4. <strong>Advocate for restoring local control</strong> through official county resolutions. Communities should have the freedom to govern themselves without mandates from Phoenix.</p>

                            <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

                            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Restore Local Control Over Short-Term Rentals</p>

                            <p>Dear Representative/Senator,</p>

                            <p>I'm writing about SB 1350, the 2016 law that stripped Arizona cities and counties of the power to regulate short-term rentals in their own communities.</p>

                            <p><strong>This is a local control issue.</strong> I believe communities — not Phoenix, not Washington, and certainly not out-of-state corporations — should decide what's appropriate in their own neighborhoods. The 2016 law was a gift to Airbnb and Expedia, pushed through with bipartisan support after heavy lobbying. It was government overreach then, and it's government overreach now.</p>

                            <p><strong>The results speak for themselves:</strong></p>

                            <p>• Tucson alone has 6,000+ short-term rentals — 90% are single-family homes removed from the housing market<br>
                            • Rents have skyrocketed while wages haven't kept pace and houses sit empty<br>
                            • Residential neighborhoods have become commercial districts without any say from the people who live there<br>
                            • Out-of-state investors extract profits while communities bear the costs</p>

                            <p><strong>I'm asking you to:</strong></p>

                            <p>1. Support legislation that restores the right of cities and counties to regulate short-term rentals as they see fit<br>
                            2. Oppose any further preemption of local authority on this issue<br>
                            3. Stand with Arizona homeowners and communities over corporate special interests</p>

                            <p>This isn't a partisan issue — it's about whether Arizonans have the freedom to govern their own communities. I hope you'll stand with your constituents and against out-of-state special interests.</p>
