                    Across Tucson, the house next door is increasingly likely to be a vacation rental — not a home. Gates Pass and neighborhoods throughout Pima County are feeling the squeeze as investors snap up houses and convert them into mini-hotels.

                            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Support Short-Term Rental Regulation in Pima County</p>

                            <p>Dear [Representative/Supervisor],</p>

                            <p>As a resident of the Gates Pass area in Tucson, I am writing to urge action on short-term rental regulation. Our residential neighborhood is being transformed by the proliferation of STRs operating as de facto hotels, and we need the county to take meaningful steps within its existing authority.</p>

                            <p><strong>I respectfully request that Pima County:</strong></p>

                            <p>1. <strong>Establish a permit/license system for STR operators</strong> with the maximum allowable fee ($250). This would create accountability by providing a mechanism to suspend permits for bad actors, while generating revenue for enforcement activities.</p>

                            <p>2. <strong>Use permit data to ensure tax compliance.</strong> The Assessor's office should be able to identify STRs and confirm they are collecting and remitting Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT). Currently, many operators avoid these obligations, shifting the burden to compliant taxpayers.</p>

                            <p>3. <strong>Create a public online registry/dashboard</strong> so neighbors and HOAs can easily identify STRs in their communities and understand their rights under existing law.</p>

                            <p>4. <strong>Advocate for restoring local control</strong> through official county resolutions and lobbying the state legislature. Communities should have the authority to regulate commercial activity in residential areas.</p>

                            <p>Homes should be for neighbors, not tourists. I urge you to take aggressive action within existing constraints while working toward meaningful reform at the state level.</p>

                            <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
