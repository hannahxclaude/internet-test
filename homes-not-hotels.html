                    Short-term rentals are transforming our residential neighborhoods into commercial districts. Houses that once held families now operate as de facto hotels, straining infrastructure, disrupting communities, and eroding the character of places like Gates Pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arizona state law currently limits what counties and cities can do to regulate STRs. But there are still meaningful actions our county can take right now — and we can advocate for restoring local control.

                            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Support Short-Term Rental Regulation in Pima County</p>

                            <p>Dear [Representative/Supervisor],</p>

                            <p>As a resident of the Gates Pass area in Tucson, I am writing to urge action on short-term rental regulation. Our residential neighborhood is being transformed by the proliferation of STRs operating as de facto hotels, and we need the county to take meaningful steps within its existing authority.</p>

                            <p><strong>I respectfully request that Pima County:</strong></p>

                            <p>1. <strong>Establish a permit/license system for STR operators</strong> with the maximum allowable fee ($250). This would create accountability by providing a mechanism to suspend permits for bad actors, while generating revenue for enforcement activities.</p>

                            <p>2. <strong>Use permit data to ensure tax compliance.</strong> The Assessor's office should be able to identify STRs and confirm they are collecting and remitting Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT). Currently, many operators avoid these obligations, shifting the burden to compliant taxpayers.</p>

                            <p>3. <strong>Create a public online registry/dashboard</strong> so neighbors and HOAs can easily identify STRs in their communities and understand their rights under existing law.</p>

                            <p>4. <strong>Advocate for restoring local control</strong> through official county resolutions and lobbying the state legislature. Communities should have the authority to regulate commercial activity in residential areas.</p>

                            <p>Homes should be for neighbors, not tourists. I urge you to take aggressive action within existing constraints while working toward meaningful reform at the state level.</p>

                            <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
