                <h2>On Brutalism</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    "Brutalism tries to face up to a mass-production society, and drag a rough poetry out of the confused and powerful forces which are at work."
                    <cite>— Alison and Peter Smithson, 1957</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Brutalist architecture emerged in the 1950s as a bold rejection of decorative excess. Named from the French <em>béton brut</em> (raw concrete), these buildings stand as monuments to civic ambition, democratic ideals, and the belief that public institutions deserve powerful architectural expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, many of these structures face demolition threats—not because they have failed, but because they challenge us. They demand attention. They refuse to be ignored. This archive exists to document their significance and advocate for their preservation.

                            The current administration has threatened to demolish or drastically alter several significant federal buildings in Washington, D.C., including the HUD headquarters—a building named after a civil rights hero.

                                        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Protect Historic Federal Buildings — Specific Legislative Requests</p>
                                        <p>Dear [Representative/Senator],</p>
                                        <p>As your constituent, I am writing with specific legislative requests to protect America's historically significant federal buildings from demolition.</p>
                                        <p>Buildings like the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building (HUD Headquarters) — named after the first African American cabinet secretary — represent major achievements in American civic architecture. Demolishing them wastes billions in taxpayer resources while erasing our architectural heritage.</p>
                                        <p><strong>I urge you to support the following:</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>1. FY2027 Transportation-HUD Appropriations:</strong><br>
                                        Include language stating: "None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to demolish or initiate demolition proceedings for the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building in Washington, D.C."</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. FY2027 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations:</strong><br>
                                        Include language stating: "None of the funds made available to the General Services Administration may be used to demolish any federal building that is listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic Places, without completion of the Section 106 review process and a 180-day notification to the Committees on Appropriations."</p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Any GSA Modernization or Federal Property Legislation:</strong><br>
                                        Require that "highest and best use" determinations for federal property explicitly include historic, architectural, and cultural value — not solely financial return. Evaluation criteria should include, but not be limited to: percentage of structure composed of exposed concrete, embodiment of democratic values through architectural form, and representation of significant 20th-century design movements.</p>
                                        <p>These buildings belong to the American people. Congress has both the power and the responsibility to protect them.</p>
                                        <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. I would appreciate a response outlining your position on these specific requests.</p>
